# MUST BE FORMATTED AS FOLLOWS:
# tank,tank2/dps1,dps2/support1,support2/win(orloss)
# you dont need to fill every slot. use none when you dont have someone you know
# examples:
# luke/mar/kayla/win
# none/mar/kayla/loss
# none/luke,mar/kayla/win
# luke,mar/aiden,ray/kayla,dalton/win
# comments are separators for multiple players in a role
# slashes are separators for different roles
# if you are playing marvel rivals or want to add a mvp for whatever reason:
# luke(mvp),aiden/mar/kayla/win
# in this case, luke is the mvp.
# i treat mvp and svp the same, just say mvp. you can see the win loss ratio for mvps
